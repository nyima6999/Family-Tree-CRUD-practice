I want convert this app to a listing website, where one can list ads. 

# Technologies Used
-React Front End
-Express Back End

# Features
- design a nice ads templates and add animations wherever necessary to make ads more interactive
- add  user login authentification



Access: You can access the app by clicking this Front End: https://family-treeee.herokuapp.com/ Back End: https://family-treebackend.herokuapp.com/

Approach: To build a user friendly client-side data entry app. This app allows the users to enter family memeber's data and to keep record of family lineage from generation to generation.  

Technologies Used: This app is purly build on react.js, with use of CSS for styling, and heroku for deployment.

User Stories: The users can enter their family data such as name, relationship and gender and store them in cloud database, so that they can access family lineage any time. 

Stretch Goals: Some ideas we can further implement into the app in the future:

add an image of the person, add birthdate of the person, add login features, and  expand more family lineage database.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
